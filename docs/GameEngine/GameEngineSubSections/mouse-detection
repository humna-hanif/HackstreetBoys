# Mouse Detection

## Mouse Input

There is a `Mouse` class in the engine that handles detecting when a mouse is being used/clicked. The class is a "static" class (meaning it can't be instantiated) and exists
solely to poll the global mouse state, which is generally used in `update` methods to be used to check if a mouse is currently being pressed or not. 
Every class has the ability to detect mouse input and multiple classes can detect mouse input at the same time and react to it as desired.

## Mouse Detection Methods
The `Mouse` class supplies the following methods:
- **mouseClicked** -- check if mouse is being clicked
- **setGamePanel** -- calls current game panel so mouse class can use its method
- **setScreenCoordinator** -- checks screen state to switch the game
- **setSpriteToClick** -- determine which specific sprite is being clicked
- **getMouseListener** -- returns mouse listener


Since these methods are all static methods, they can be referenced directly from the `Mouse` type
